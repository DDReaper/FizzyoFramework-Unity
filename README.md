A Unity package for Fizzyo game development .

This project aims to create games to help children with their breathing exercises by using games to relieve the burden of the treatment, whilst also capturing critical health data to improve clinical outcomes and future treatments.

## Background on Cystic Fibrosis

Cystic Fibrosis is a chronic, life-limiting condition affecting sufferers from birth. Approximately 1 in 2500 babies are born with CF. With improved prevention and treatment life expectancy for patients has slowly increased and currently stands at an average of 41 years of age. CF physiotherapy is a series of breathing exercises undertaken as the main preventative treatment for CF. Patients are asked to do physio two or more times a day using dedicated breathing equipment to help expel mucus and fluid from their lungs. The Fizzyo device is a wireless sensor that connects to existing CF Physiotherapy equipment, turning breaths into controls for video games.

Project Fizzyo attempts to tackle some key challenges associated with chronic preventative in-home care:

* How do we improve patient adherence to this form of life-long treatment when benefits are not immediate?
* How do we use technology to connect the Clinician to the patient, so this traditionally analogue treatment can be monitored and made visible at point of clinical review, correlated with other health factors?
* How can we study the long-term efficacy of CF Physiotherapy and its impact on patient health given no such data has ever been collected or analysed?

## Creating a Game for Fizzyo

We've made it incredibly easy to start building your Fizzyo project and registering it with the Fizzyo cloud services.

To get started, you can follow these guides:

* [Register your Game with the Fizzyo cloud services](/RegisteringyourGame.md) - Used to integrate your game with the Fizzyo backend.
* [Downloading the Fizzyo Framework and integrating it with your project](/InstallingFizzyoFramework.md)
* [Building your Project for UWP](/BuildingYourProject.md)

Once your Windows 10 UWP package is created, it's read for submitting to the Fizzyo project.
