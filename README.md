## Creating a Game for Fizzyo

We've made it incredibly easy to start building your Fizzyo project and registering it with the Fizzyo cloud services.

To get started, you can follow these guides:

* [Register your Game with the Fizzyo cloud services](/RegisteringyourGame.md) - Used to integrate your game with the Fizzyo backend.
* [Downloading the Fizzyo Framework and integrating it with your project](/InstallingFizzyoFramework.md)

Once your Windows 10 UWP package is created, it's read for submitting to the Fizzyo project.
